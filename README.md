Secret number - a short game to guess a secret number. 

In a language of your choice, write a solution for the game that satisfies the following criteria:

Generates a random number.

Takes in a guess.

Returns a string with the guess and whether that guess is lower or higher than the random number. E.g., “You answered 9. The correct answer is higher.”

If the guess matches the random number, then return a string which confirms this. E.g., “You answered 9. This is the correct answer!”
